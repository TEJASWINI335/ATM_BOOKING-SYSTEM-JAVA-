The ATM simulation project successfully implements a basic yet functional ATM system using Java, covering essential banking operations like user authentication, balance checks, deposits, withdrawals, PIN changes, transaction history tracking, and interest calculation. The system emphasizes security by limiting login attempts, confirming critical actions, and ensuring proper validation of user inputs.

By applying object-oriented programming principles, the project demonstrates effective management of user accounts and transaction data. The modular design of methods makes the system easy to maintain and extend in the future. This project not only serves as a practical implementation of core ATM functionalities but also provides a foundation for building more advanced banking systems with additional features and security measures.

Overall, the ATM simulation provides a solid framework for understanding key concepts in software development, user interaction, and secure data management
